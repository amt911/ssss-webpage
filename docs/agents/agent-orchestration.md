## Agent orchestration — parallel where it's free, batched where it's yours

Delegating to agents moves the bottleneck to **scheduling**: what waits on what, what each agent
re-derives, and which decisions quietly stop being yours. Same convention — every rule carries its
measured number.

- **Review is not on the critical path.** Reviewing task N and starting N+1 are independent when
  they touch different files. Serialized, review is **10-15% of the wall clock** and blocks
  everything behind it; in parallel it is free. **On receiving an implementation report, dispatch
  its review and the next implementation in the same turn.** This is the one exception to
  *"at most 1 agent at a time"*: the cap counts **implementation** agents — a review agent reads and
  reports, it writes nothing, so it cannot race the implementer. **The exclusive resource here is:**
  the dev database, the dev-server port and the Playwright browser
  — at most one agent touching it.
- **Keep one shared facts file.** Every fresh agent re-derives the same things: the real selector,
  which fake exists, what that helper accepts. Keep `docs/FACTS.md`, have each agent append to it
  when it finishes, and hand it to the next one in its dispatch. Only **facts verified against the
  repo or the running system**, with how they were verified. It is not the gotchas log: that holds
  what is *not* deducible from the code and outlives the branch; this holds what is perfectly
  deducible and merely expensive to look up, and it may die with the branch.
- **Plans carry contracts, not literal code.** The agent **trusts** the code in the plan; code you
  never compiled is an error wearing authority. **Measured: 4 wrong blocks, 15-40 min of detour
  each.** Write exact names, exact signatures and "mirror the shape of `<X>`" — claims the agent can
  check against the repo — and reserve literal code for what you have run.
- **Batch the discretionary decisions.** Work that appears along the way — a capability being
  dropped, a missing script, an adjacent bug — added **5-6 h of 15**. Each was justified; deciding
  them on the fly is what takes them away from you. Accumulate and ask **once per batch, with the
  estimated cost**. In **"modo desatendido"** the batch goes in the PR body instead, with its costs.
- **What never gets cut.** Review was **1.5 h of 15** and found a `create()` silently discarding
  fields, a 404 caused by SQL deduplication, a silent merge that corrupted data, a
  delete-and-recreate with no transaction, and several inert assertions. **Cutting review does not
  give time back; it defers it to production.** Cut reproduction (write the shortcut) and
  serialization (dispatch review in parallel) instead.

### Day one — the numbers that fill the blanks

1. **The lap** — time `build → deploy → reach the state → observe` once and write the seconds into
   the table above. The dominant phase gets the shortcut script; the rest stay unoptimized.
2. **The exclusive resource** — confirm the one named above is really the only one.
3. **The inert assertions** — break one assertion on purpose and run the suite; anything still green
   is inert. Then prune the table above to what this stack can actually produce.
