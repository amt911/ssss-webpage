## Design principles — SOLID, applied with judgement

SOLID is a list of **symptoms to look for**, not a pattern to apply. Every one of the five exists to
keep a change local: the useful question is *how many files does the next plausible change touch, and
how many of them do you have to understand first?* Applied by rote it produces the opposite — an
interface per class, a factory for one product, an eight-file feature — so here it is bounded by YAGNI
and by **Reuse before you write** (see [Working rules](../../AGENTS.md#working-rules)).

| Principle | Checkable smell | Usual fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S — Single responsibility**: one reason to change | the description needs "and"; the file changes in PRs about unrelated features; a test mocks things unrelated to what it asserts; a component both fetches and lays out | split along the reason to change — IO, decision, presentation |
| **O — Open/closed**: extend without editing | adding a case edits a growing `switch`/`if` chain in several places; one boolean prop per variant | a variants map, strategy, slot or registry — introduced at the second real case, not the first |
| **L — Liskov substitution**: subtypes keep the contract | an override throws "not supported"; callers check the concrete type before calling; a variant drops the base's disabled, focus or semantics | narrow the base contract, or stop inheriting and compose |
| **I — Interface segregation**: clients see only what they use | a fake implements methods the test never calls; a whole entity is passed to read two fields; a `Service` with fifteen methods | split by client need; pass the fields, not the bag |
| **D — Dependency inversion**: policy does not import mechanism | domain or UI code imports `fetch`, the ORM, `Date.now()` or `fs` directly; a unit test needs a network or a database | depend on a port the caller owns (interface, function, hook); wire the adapter at the edge |

### In this codebase

- **S:** `src/ui/main.ts` only wires the DOM (`initApp(document)`); it does not also decide validation
  or crypto rules — that lives in `src/core`. A DOM handler that also computes a business rule is doing
  two jobs.
- **O:** a new share format or validation rule extends `src/core` (a new codec, a new `validate` rule)
  rather than growing a chain of `if`s inside `main.ts`.
- **L:** every error in `src/core/errors.ts` (`ValidationError`, `ShareFormatError`,
  `DuplicateShareError`, `IntegrityError`) extends `Error` and keeps its contract — `.message`,
  `.name`, `instanceof Error` — so `explainError(e)` and any `catch` treat them uniformly; a subtype
  that dropped `.message` or threw on access would break every caller silently.
- **I:** the functions `src/ui/main.ts` imports from `src/core` are narrow and named (`splitSecret`,
  `combineShares`, `secretSizeWarning`, `explainError`), never a whole module passed around to pick two
  exports out of it.
- **D:** `src/ui/main.ts` depends on `src/core`'s pure functions, never the other way — `src/core`
  never touches `document`, `window` or the DOM. That boundary is what the Vitest `node` environment
  enforces (see [Tests and quality](../../AGENTS.md#tests-and-quality)) and what keeps `src/core` mutation-testable.

### Where the seams go

| Stack | Seams |
| --- | --- |
| Web (vanilla TypeScript, no framework) | `src/core/` is pure decision logic (crypto codec, validation, error mapping) with zero DOM or IO access; `src/ui/main.ts` is the only file that touches `document`/`window` and owns all side effects; `build.mjs` is the sole tooling/IO boundary (esbuild, filesystem, hashing) — nothing else touches the filesystem |

### Where SOLID stops

- **No interface, abstract class or factory without one of:** a second real implementation, an IO
  boundary (network, database, filesystem, clock, randomness, OS), or a test that cannot be written
  without the seam. "We might swap it later" is not on the list.
- **Reuse first beats speculative extension points:** add the parameter to the existing thing before
  inventing a plugin system for it.
- **Speculative abstraction is a review finding**, exactly like a violation: an interface with one
  implementation and no IO behind it gets inlined.
- **Refactor toward SOLID when a change hurts**, in the PR that felt the pain — not as a drive-by
  rewrite of code nobody is changing.
